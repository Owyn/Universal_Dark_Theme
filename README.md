<h2><b>Important Notes:</b></h2>
Userscript works well on simplemistic website designs with little color gradients and lack of shades used, because it makes all backgrounds into one background color and all text colors into one text color.

Moreover not all website designs are competently done and might (and likely would) contain borked elements which would require hammering them out with your CSS (web style programming) knowledge. Or you could just look for a ready-to-use userstyle for that specific website on userstyles.org or in google with "website.com dark theme script" search and not bother.

There is no such thing as magic<br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/369683046468681729.png">

However simple one-click dark theme applicator (or a handy tool to craft dark themes - I noticed I was using the same CSS dark style for quite a lot of websites and decided to make this universal one instead) would be enough in many cases.

Is some website broken ? (especially if you use high-contrast windows theme) - no problem, just one click and:<br>
